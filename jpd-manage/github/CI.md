### 2.1 JFrog for GitHub Dependabot  
GitHub Dependabot is a tool for identifying vulnerabilities in source code dependencies, but it can often generate a high volume of security alerts, making it challenging for developers to prioritize fixes. The JFrog integration with GitHub Dependabot is designed to solve this problem by cutting through the noise, analyzing each vulnerability's context and exploitability, and helping you focus on what truly matters.
